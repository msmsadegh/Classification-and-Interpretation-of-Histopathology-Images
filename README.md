# Classification and Interpretation of Histopathology Images  
### Leveraging Ensemble of EfficientNetV1 and EfficientNetV2 Models

**A Deep Learning-Based Approach for Breast Cancer Histopathology Image Analysis**

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and supplementary materials for our project on breast cancer histopathology image classification. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art EfficientNetV1 and EfficientNetV2 models, ensemble learning techniques, and Grad-CAM interpretability to achieve superior performance on the BreaKHis dataset. This work accompanies our paper submission to *Scientific Reports*.

## Project Overview
In this project, we address the critical task of accurately classifying histopathology images into benign and malignant categories. Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths among women, and early detection plays a crucial role in treatment planning and patient care.

**Key Highlights:**
- **Models:** We use EfficientNetV1 (variants b0â€“b4) and EfficientNetV2 (variant b0-s) architectures, known for their efficiency and strong performance in image classification tasks.
- **Ensemble Learning:** To further boost performance, ensemble methods such as unweighted averaging and hard (majority) voting are employed.
- **Interpretability:** Grad-CAM is applied to provide visual explanations of the modelâ€™s decisions, increasing transparency and trust in our predictions.
- **Dataset:** Our experiments are conducted on the widely used BreaKHis dataset, which comprises histopathological images of breast cancer at various magnifications.
- **Results:** Our best ensemble model achieved an accuracy of 99.58%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.
